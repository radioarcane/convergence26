               <p>DJ Ichabod has been an active DJ in the Goth/Industrial scene in Nashville for over twenty years now, starting out as a radio DJ on WRVU in the mid-’90s. During his years there, he created the show, Out ov the Coffin, which ran until the station folded in 2011, at which point it became a monthly podcast that continues to this day. In the late '90s, his radio work led to his first club DJ gig at the Underground in Nashville, and from there, he went on to co-run the events, Communion at the Asylum (Nashville's first-ever Saturday night Goth club) and then +SALVATION+, which ran as Nashville's primary Goth event for over ten years, across multiple venues, branching into concert promotion as well.</p>
					
					<p>In 2013, he started his own night, Fascination Street at The East Room, a post-punk, deathrock, darkwave, and trad-Goth specialty dance event, which just marked its sixth anniversary. He also serves as assistant director of Dragon Con's Horror Track, where he creates Goth-related programming.</p>
