               <p>Twin Tribes is a dark synth / post-punk duo based in Brownsville, Texas. Formed by Luis Navarro (vocals, guitar, synth, drum machines) and Joel Niño, Jr. (bass, synth, vocals) in 2017, the band gathers their influences from the period of the dark ‘80s. Darkwave, post-punk, and coldwave are genres that the band summon using analog synthesizers and drum machines; dark melodic sounds, lyrics of the undead, the occult, and parallel universes are what conjure Twin Tribes.</p>

               <p>2019 was indeed a banner year for goth-pop duo WINGTIPS, who released their debut record, Exposure Therapy, on Toronto-based Artoffact Records. The duo comprises Chicago-goth mainstays Vincent and Hannah, producing unforgettable music that has already captured the attention of media and festival taste-makers alike.</p>

               <p>The new record, which finds its guitar work inherently in the vein of Disintegration-era Cure, while injecting electronic elements you might hear at home on records by OMD, is an androgynous sound of transition. Interpolating darkly shimmering layers of angular guitar and pulsating darkwave, WINGTIPS sharpens their anthemic rush with an increasing penchant for melody and an atmosphere equally informed by post-punk as sweeping electronica. Exposure Therapy is a contextualization of new romantic for post-millennial end times, and a refreshing mix of synthpop and darkwave with hooks so compelling they are cinematic in scope.</p>

Influences on their dark post-punk sound include Killing Joke, Bauhaus, Chameleons, and The Sisters of Mercy.</p>

               <p>Hailing from Louisville, Kentucky, Scary Black is the solo project of multi-instrumentalist / singer / songwriter Albie Mason. Everything is written, recorded, mixed and mastered in his bedroom studio with knowledge he gained from watching hours upon hours of online videos, and years of trial and error. With the guitar as his primary instrument, he shreds away alongside chugging bass synths. Haunting vocals place themselves in the mix like a ghost trapped between worlds with no hope of escape.</p>
