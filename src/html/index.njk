         <p class="drop-cap">Nestled in the dead center of the states that comprise the US’s Midwest, East, and South sits Kentucky, and the best features of each of these regions are well-represented in Louisville. Its burgeoning art, music, theater, and culinary cultures, combined with its rich history and natural splendor, themselves, have much to offer, and, oh… we have a Goth scene, too.</p>

         <p>These Victorian-era garden cemeteries aren’t just going to appreciate themselves, after all.</p>

         <p><a href="https://www.radio-arcane.com" target="_blank">Radio Arcane</a>, <a href="http://www.art-sanctuary.org">Art Sanctuary</a>, and really, all of Louisville are delighted that our fair city has been chosen for Convergence 26. We have much to share with you. Please join us for such delights on the weekend of May 15-17, 2020.</p>

         <h3 class="title">What is Convergence?</h3>

         <p>In 1994, the geographically disparate denizens of the Usenet group, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/alt.gothic" target="_blank">alt.gothic</a>, decided that at long last, it was time to meet IRL. Collectively, they decided that Chicago was just the right place, and lo, the first Convergence was born.</p>

         <p>In the twenty-five years since, it has become an annual party—a family reunion of sorts—and has grown to include members of the myriad Gothic/Industrial online and social media groups it spawned, as well as the broader worldwide Goth community—“friends of friends,” as it were. Hundreds of net.goths from around the globe descend upon a single city for a weekend of socializing, musical events, and various forms of indulgence.</p>

         <p>Now in its twenty-sixth year, Louisville, Kentucky’s winning bid means that we get to bring you something altogether new, and yet still, entirely familiar.</p>

The duo comprises Chicago-goth mainstays Vincent and Hannah, producing unforgettable music that has already captured the attention of media and festival taste-makers alike. The new record, which finds its guitar work inherently in the vein of Disintegration-era Cure, while injecting electronic elements you might hear at home on records by OMD, is an androgynous sound of transition. Interpolating darkly shimmering layers of angular guitar and pulsating darkwave, WINGTIPS sharpens their anthemic rush with an increasing penchant for melody and an atmosphere equally informed by post-punk as sweeping electronica. Exposure Therapy is a contextualization of new romantic for post-millennial end times, and a refreshing mix of synthpop and darkwave with hooks so compelling they are cinematic in scope.","image":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://www.convergence26.com/images/bands/wingtips.jpg"},"genre":["Synthpop","Darkwave","Gothic"],"sameAs":["http://www.wingtipswebsite.com","https://www.facebook.com/wingtipschicago","https://www.instagram.com/_wingtips","https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCS4pR09tPXC0oOabf1yWuaQ","https://wingtips.bandcamp.com","https://soundcloud.com/wingtips","https://open.spotify.com/artist/3ulf7xARUpgwKu0AH38bGR","https://music.apple.com/artist/1174550090","https://play.google.com/store/music/artist?id=Av2algfr5r375tn5mt5425tclue","https://www.discogs.com/artist/6169972-Wingtips","https://www.last.fm/music/Wingtips","https://www.songkick.com/artists/1725871-wingtips","https://www.bandsintown.com/a/8158073-wingtips?came_from=251"]},{"@type":"MusicGroup","@id":"https://musicbrainz.org/artist/5cd1e9e1-add1-4c15-9c36-246cd25658c8","name":"The Bellwether Syndicate","description":"Formed in 2012, The Bellwether Syndicate is fronted by veteran artist William Faith (vocals/guitars), and Sarah Rose Faith (vocals/guitars).

As underground musical trends have come and gone over the years, God Module have stayed at the forefront of the dark electronic scene. Mixing harsh musical styles (punk, death rock and metal) with his love for electronic music (EBM, industrial, synthpop and techno), God Module was created. Incorporating imagery and aesthetics from his interest in the horror genre and the paranormal, God Module has taken on a dark persona over the years. The band is currently signed to Metropolis Records in North America and Infacted Recordings in Europe, and released their eighth studio album, The Unsound, in July 2019. Jasyn has brought his childhood dreams to life as musical nightmares, taking all the common electro - Gothic - industrial cliches and systematically tearing them apart. They are unnaturally stitched back together again to create a constantly mutating soundtrack to the most disturbing horror film you will never see.","image":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://www.convergence26.com/images/bands/god-module.jpg"},"genre":["Industrial","Electro-Industrial","Dark Electro","EBM"],"sameAs":["http://www.godmodule.org","https://www.facebook.com/godmodule","https://www.instagram.com/godmodule","https://twitter.com/God__Module","https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKghybBJlpdNSUrH1v_JHpA","https://godmodule.bandcamp.com","https://open.spotify.com/artist/1DoGu017HBH9armSl4M0Sb","https://music.apple.com/artist/5985460","https://www.discogs.com/artist/67558-God-Module"]},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"MusicGroup","@id":"https://musicbrainz.org/artist/d404fbd5-e606-452d-93b8-f38c8fe00e13","name":"Xorcist","description":"Peter Stone started writing electronic music in 1985 when he acquired a rare PPG Wave 2.3, EVU, and Waveterm.

Over the next ten years, Xorcist released six more CDs, was featured on countless compilations, had two side projects (XENON and Diode Fetish), scored several CD-ROM video games, grew the online social media community, CyberDen, to over global proportions, worked on MTV's Aeon Flux series, toured as a technical guru for the 1993 Lollapalooza CyberPit installation, co-owned and co-ran the bay area's largest Gothic and industrial club, House of Usher, and somewhere in there, did a national Xorcist tour. Then on 9/11, 2001, the world changed and Xorcist was forced onto the back-burner while jobs disappeared and higher priorities took precedence. But finally, in 2018, Xorcist returned with a new full-length release entitled: GOD.

Josh has an extensive background in electronic music and audio engineering; formerly known as DJ Impulse, he used to make music under monikers Sinthetix/Corrupt Souls in the drum ’n’ bass genre, gaining worldwide recognition in the scene before permanently retiring from it. Luna has always experimented with keyboards and music composition from a young age, but pursued photography, writing and film in college—constantly involved in the arts throughout her life. Once Luna and Josh met, it became obvious after just a few months that they would be making music together. To keep it interesting, they're always taking turns on everything in their sound: vocals, arps, riffs, bass, drums, pads, and the production/engineering of the different aspects of their sound. There is nothing in the process of making music that one does more than the other, in the attempt to explore both artists capabilities. Every single aspect of their work, from making sound from scratch to EQ’ing and engineering the sound is made by either Luna or Josh, and is what makes two artists one S Y Z Y G Y X. Josh and Luna continue to grow and learn about sound by also mixing and mastering all of their own music. They work from their home studio in the Washington, D.C. metro area, and continue to evolve within their sound. S Y Z Y G Y X’s first EP, Hex’n Equinox, was released in 2018 on Cleopatra Records. As they experimented with their sound and in trying to find themselves in their music, they, later in 2018, released their sophomore EP, Broken Mirrors, under their home label, Burning Grave Records. As they progressed with their composition and engineering, they signed their next EP, Encounters, to German label Cold Transmission, and in 2019 released their debut LP, Is That All There Is, under home label Burning Grave Records. Their second LP, Fading Bodies, was released in the fall of 2019 under the label partnership of Negative Gain Productions (US) and Cold Transmission (EU).","image":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://www.convergence26.com/images/bands/syzygyx.jpg"},"genre":["Darkwave","EBM","Coldwave","Dark Synth"],"sameAs":["https://www.syzygyxmusic.com","https://www.facebook.com/syzygyxmusic","https://instagram.com/syzygyx_music","https://twitter.com/syzygyxmusic","https://syzygy-x.bandcamp.com","https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgyRTWZwopj47hh-T9eXodw","https://open.spotify.com/artist/4WSJtJKAMPDSzGfamNOmAa","https://soundcloud.com/syzygyx","https://itunes.apple.com/artist/1368239798","https://www.discogs.com/artist/6827690-SYZYGYX","https://play.google.com/store/music/artist/S_Y_Z_Y_G_Y_X?id=Afhxr3indjsadlpfwhhjogzry5u"]},{"@type":"MusicGroup","@id":"https://musicbrainz.org/artist/58235a60-c5cc-4d83-b26d-c94b57048e83","name":"Scary Black","description":"Hailing from Louisville, Kentucky, Scary Black is the solo project of multi-instrumentalist / singer / songwriter Albie Mason.

Originally a three-piece band fronted by Scary Black singer Albie Mason, with Abbas Marler on bass and Zac Campbell on guitars and programming, TKV has evolved over the years with Albie leaving to do his own music and Abbas stepping up for vocal duties. After going through a number of bass players, The Kentucky Vampires finally landed a permanent member in Motuvius Rex. While assessing the future with more focus on live performances, TKV has also recently added veteran drummer Thom Warnock (the longtime drummer for the metal band Stagecoach Inferno) to the band.","image":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://www.convergence26.com/images/bands/the-kentucky-vampires.jpg"},"genre":["Gothic Rock","Deathrock"],"sameAs":["https://www.facebook.com/thekentuckyvampires","https://www.instagram.com/the_kentucky_vampires","https://thekentuckyvampires.bandcamp.com","https://open.spotify.com/artist/4pDaeQGSiBVjORVjvwCDVP","https://music.apple.com/artist/1467851425","https://play.google.com/store/music/artist?id=Atu67obztsafypufvy753p7roje","https://www.discogs.com/artist/7570414-The-Kentucky-Vampires"]},{"@type":"MusicGroup","@id":"https://musicbrainz.org/artist/c77f550e-dc57-42f6-a191-b9f3610f99c9","name":"Vyva Melinkolya","description":"Founded in Louisville, KY by Alyc Diaz as a solo project in 2014, Vyva Melinkolya is trans-fronted, aggressively ethereal music—slow, moody shoegaze and dream pop with swirling melodies and drum machines.
